# 🐇 Solid Hop

💙 A **minimal** and **unopinionated** Vike + Solid + Hono starter.

❤️ We love Vike and Solid, but it might be overwhelming to setup. The goal of this starter is to get you up and running quickly with good defaults without getting in the way of your opinions.

This is more or less what you would get from a starter with `create next-app` or `create svelte` or `create solid`.

If you want a more opinionated and fully-featured boilerplate instead: http://github.com/blankeos/solid-launch
